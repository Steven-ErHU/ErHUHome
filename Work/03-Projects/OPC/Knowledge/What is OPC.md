# What is OPC?

__OPC__ is the interoperability standard(交互标准) for the __secure__ and __reliable__ __exchange of data__ in the industrial automation space and in other industries.  
It is __platform independent__ and ensures __the seamless flow of information among devices from multiple vendors__.  
The __OPC Foundation__ is responsible for the development and maintenance of this standard.

The OPC standard is a series of specifications developed by industry vendors, end-users and software developers.  
These specifications define the __interface between Clients and Servers__, as well as __Servers and Servers__, including __access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, access to historical data__ and other applications.

When the standard was __first released in 1996__, its purpose was to abstract __PLC specific protocols__ (such as Modbus, Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing __HMI/SCADA systems__ to interface with a “middle-man” who would convert generic-OPC read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.  
As a result, an entire cottage industry of products emerged allowing end-users to implement systems using best-of-breed(最佳组合) products all seamlessly interacting via OPC.

Initially, the OPC standard was restricted to the Windows operating system.  
As such, the acronym(首字母缩写) __OPC__ was borne from __OLE (object linking and embedding) for Process Control__.  
These specifications, which are now known as __OPC Classic__, have enjoyed widespread adoption across multiple industries, including __manufacturing, building automation, oil and gas, renewable energy and utilities, among others__.

With the introduction of __service-oriented architectures__ in manufacturing systems came new challenges in security and data modeling.  
The OPC Foundation developed the __OPC UA__ specifications to address these needs and at the same time provided a feature-rich technology open-platform architecture that was future-proof, scalable and extensible.

Today the acronym __OPC__ stands for __Open Platform Communications__.

These are just some of the reasons why so many members and other technology organizations (collaborations) are turning to OPC UA for their interoperability platform.
